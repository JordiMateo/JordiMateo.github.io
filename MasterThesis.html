                                More and more organizations are using optimization, simulation and big data techniques
                                to make better decisions and reduce risks. Big companies are improving their economic
                                activities by investing  in business analytics or operation research.  However, small
                                companies are not able to afford this kind of inversions. This article proposes a new
                                software as a service (SAAS) to bring the huge potential and benefits of linear
                                optimization to daily activity of small companies and common people.
                                The service described in this article allows solving optimization models through a
                                simple step-by-step user interface. Thus, the only requirement to execute a model and
                                analyze its results is  an electronic device connected to the net. The results obtained
                                show the usability and the competitive advantages of using the proposed service
                                by decisions makers in whatever real life activity.

                                Optimization models are being more used to tackle agro-business prob- lems. This way,
                                cloud computing, machine learning, big data, internet of things and optimization are key
                                factors in the innovation of the sector. This paper proposes a cloud architecture to
                                suggest a ranking of candidate sows to be replaced and a set of tools to help the farmers
                                to make better strategic, tactical and operational decisions related with the structure of
                                the sow farms. The cloud architecture automatizes the process to obtain the results,
                                making the process transparent to the farmer. This work extends the advantages of
                                optimization models with the potential of cloud computing. The results shows that the
                                cloud architecture proposed helps decisions makers in real pig farms to make a better
                                planning by obtaining the competitive advantages of using the proposed model in a usable,
                                exible and simple way.

            <div class="panel">

                <div align="left">

                            <p>
                                This project consists in two parts due to the double degree in Computer Engineering and
                                Administration and Business Management requirements. The first one presents and approaches
                                a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model. The model conceived for pig production
                                planning has the objective to optimize the entire pig supply chain according to the
                                number of farms operating for the same company or cooperative. The model maximizes the
                                revenue calculated from the income of sales to the abattoir and the production costs.

                                Production costs depends on each type of farm involved in the process.
                                Factors like farm capacity, trucks available and transportation costs are considered,
                                among others. The model considers a medium-term planning horizon and specifically provides
                                optimal transport planning in terms of number of animals to be transported from one facility
                                to another and the number of trucks to do so. The algebraic modelling software OPL studio,
                                in combination with the solver CPLEX both from IBM ILOG have been used to solve the model
                                and study its properties and behaviour.

                                In addition, a potential improvement in the execution time has been sought considering
                                that a real application of the model is expected. This has been done through the generation
                                of instances variating the number of farms that take part in each execution. The instances
                                are required to apply a genetic algorithm on the search space defined by the cartesian product
                                of the solver domains. Once a given time limit elapses, it returns the value of the parameters
                                for which it has had a superior performance on average over the group of instances. Then,
                                the results are analysed and the variations of the model execution time are studied.

                                The second part of the project consists in developing a decision support system (DSS),
                                which takes form of an application that approaches and facilitates the use of the model
                                in order to provide each user a personalized solution. In addition, a friendly interface
                                displays a google maps personalized instance presenting all the facilities that users,
                                companies and cooperatives or even farmers, have introduced to the system. The information
                                introduced will be used to run the model and generate the specific solution for the user.
                                In addition, the interface also allows users to introduce new facilities to the system and
                                visualize their current information and characteristics.

                                Power system expansion specifically for distribution networks is gaining more importance
                                due to the integration of distributed energy systems. Optimization models are more used
                                to tackle generation and transmission expansion problems (GTEP). This way, cloud computing,
                                machine learning, big data, internet of things, simulation and optimisation are critical
                                factors in the innovation of the power sector. In the recent past, a new inter-disciplinary
                                subject focusing on energy and information system called energy informatics has emerged.
                                This paper proposes a novel mathematical model to deal with GTEP regarding the collaboration
                                and competition between all the nodes and actors in the power network.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, this work proposes the usage of a parallel algorithm to solve the GTEP problem
                                using the model efficiently. This way, to assist power network companies to make better strategic,
                                tactical and operational decisions related to the investments, maintenance or evaluation
                                of the power network a cloud-based Decision Support System (DSS) is proposed.

                                Mainly, focused at:  (i) integrate the data in the system, (ii) integrate the model,
                                (iii) automate the resolution process, and finally present the results in an interactive
                                way to the end-users. This work extends the advantages of optimisation and simulation
                                models with the potential of parallel and cloud computing to automate and offer the
                                knowledge and the analytics. The results show that the decision support system proposed
                                helps decisions makers in real situations to do better planning by obtaining the competitive
                                advantages of using the proposed model in a usable, flexible and straightforward way.

                                This project consists in developing a decision support system and its integration in a
                                cloud platform to offer optimization models as a service integrated in a sole application
                                accessible from different devices. It has two parts due to the double degree in Computer
                                Engineering and Administration and Business Management requirement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The part related to the Administration and Business Management degree is based on a mixed integer
                                linear-programming (MILP) model to support marketing decisions on fattening farms without
                                individual weight control. It includes the development of the running program to solve
                                the MILP model and the assessment for specific factors. The objective is to determine
                                the optimal delivery time and quality bonus of the fattened pigs to the slaughterhouse
                                and thus, getting the best value for the producer. This mathematical model maximizes
                                the revenue and reduces the risk of neglecting opportunity costs by taking into account
                                important key factors such as: homogeneity of the batch, price-grid system,
                                transportation cost, among others. The analysis performed on this study demonstrated
                                the importance of these different factors that affect significantly on the optimal
                                marketing policy of fattening farms, and also in a vertically integrated company.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second part is related to the Computer Engineering degree and concerns the development
                                of a cloud decision support system (cDSS). The cDSS takes form of a client application
                                that allows users to run the mathematical model introduced previously and through it,
                                depict their best marketing decisions for a pig farmer. Through this application, the
                                farmer can store data and update information of the farms, make requests from different
                                devices or visualize an output display of the results obtained from the model.

                                This work presents a general parallelisation of the Progressive Hedging algorithm to

                                without (binary or integer) variables in the first stage. We report a benchmark study
                                between the computational improvements using our proposal and the parallel version (using pyro)
                                of the Pyomo integrated Progressive Hedging. Moreover, we study the influence of a

                                several step update policies by solving different instances using our proposal.
